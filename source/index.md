<h1>Hello and Welcome!</h1>

The BigBang is not a framework, it's mostly a collection of elements put together that work very well, uncovering a full stack GraphQL framework with lots of goodies and fast prototyping abilities.

The aim is to bring order into the JavaScript world where you are exposed to many options of doing the same things, our solution helps on that regard allowing you to:

- Rapidly create a project using GraphQL API
- Tight integration with an account system
- Ability to create APIs for Mobile Web Applications with ease
- Ability to have reactivity of your data in a scaleable manner
- Ability to use MongoDB with relations that scale

We are using the following web-technologies:

- Meteor (Bundler and Packaging system)
- MongoDB
- Apollo & GraphQL
- Grapher (Relational support for MongoDB)
- React

The principles it adheres to:

- Ability to rapidly create prototypes
- Ability to evolve your prototypes into scalable, solid, well-tested products
- Focus on developer experience rather than implementation details
- We value simplicity and code elegance over performance

To get started:

```
npm i -g yo generator-bigbang
yo bang
```

Let's embark together on an EPIC journey, we promise that you will not be dissapointed!
